## Introduction
Crashes due to intoxication are still prevalent in the Southern California cities of San Diego and Los Angeles. Is there a pattern or contributing factors to these crash locations? If there are, it can lead to a better understanding to help prevent DUIs with road designs, urban planning, and traffic stops. This paper will look at potential factors such as income, educational attainment, and race as well as walkability score for census tracts, and urban density.
